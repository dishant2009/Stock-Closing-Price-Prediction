This project focuses on regression based model architecture. The Regression-based Model is used to predict continuous values from a set of autonomous values. Regression makes predictions by using a given linear function to predict continuous values of the attribute ”Close”.The stock prices vary from a minimum of 2.13 dollar of a stock to 272800 dollar.
